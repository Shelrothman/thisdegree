- handeling what happens when user selevts new actor above... for now they just do not have that option as the select becomes immutable after actor inputed for it aka actorGuessed property is set to true
    - eventually, make it so that they can select a new one and when that hapens, it clears out the rest of the list below that actor and resets the actorGuessed property to false for that movier

- maybe eventually liie its a speed game kinda with a time.. and not just actors but like any kind of connections like making other connections between stuff

- for now they get to try again if enter an invalid movie. But in the future i want to have some kind of scoring system that would dock them down or somehting for entering an invalid movie..

- going to have a user-sytem bc like for the players... they can save their old games to view later (simple combo of ids and stuff).. have  a score.. share a tree they built with other users.. etc... certain trees have 'byPlayer: ' in them... (so good to have a user system in place for that eventual stuff)
<!-- * section of app like.. `view my old Treees`.. or something -->
