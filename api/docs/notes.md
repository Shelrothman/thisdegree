<!--  TODO: eventually better iding... like add the id from the data base if there is one there already kind of thing for a movie
 * and then eventually for an actor as well 
 ! yes so the db... will build as users play bc once they enter a movie, it will be fetched
 ! then, once fetched.. the movieObj will be saved to the db
 ! SO THAT the next time the movie is guessed by another user, it will be fetched from the db and not the wiki (bc that will be the first attempt the app makes)
