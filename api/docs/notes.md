<PRISMA = db | GQL = server>

<!--  TODO: eventually better iding... like add the id from the data base if there is one there already kind of thing for a movie
 * and then eventually for an actor as well 
 ! yes so the db... will build as users play bc once they enter a movie, it will be fetched
 ! then, once fetched.. the movieObj will be saved to the db
 ! SO THAT the next time the movie is guessed by another user, it will be fetched from the db and not the wiki (bc that will be the first attempt the app makes)

 /**
 * *Effectively, all the GraphQL server has to do is invoke all resolver functions for the fields that are contained in the query and then package up the response according to the queryâ€™s shape. Query resolution thus merely becomes a process of orchestrating the invocation of resolver functions!

<!-- ? we are going to want the actors id to be set as either a new uuid if theyre not in the db, OR if their already in db then use that id. -->
<!-- TODO: so we need to implement that functionality into the db/gql stuff
we need to have the castList setting include the id (the setting within the movie setting) -->

### this is the typical workflow you will follow when updating your data:
    1. Manually adjust your Prisma data model.
    2. Migrate your database using the prisma migrate CLI commands we covered.
        (`npx prisma generate`)
    3. (Re-)generate Prisma Client
    4. Use Prisma Client in your application code to access your database.
        (`npx prisma studio`) => to see the data in the db/prisma studio 
            <!--! [no need to turn this on, just if you want to see a visual] -->

```js
<!--! After every change you make to the data model, you need to migrate your database and then re-generate Prisma Client. -->
    `npx prisma migrate dev --name "title-of-migration"`
        (builds the historical record)
    THEN re-generate Prisma Client:
        `npx prisma generate`
```


<!-- ? in its most basic form, a GraphQL server will have one resolver function per field in its schema. Each resolver knows how to fetch the data for its field. Since a GraphQL query at its essence is just a collection of fields, all a GraphQL server actually needs to do in order to gather the requested data is invoke all the resolver functions for the fields specified in the query. (This is also why GraphQL often is compared to RPC-style systems, as it essentially is a language for invoking remote functions.) */ -->
