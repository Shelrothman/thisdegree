/* 
? in its most basic form, a GraphQL server will have one resolver function per field in its schema. Each resolver knows how to fetch the data for its field. Since a GraphQL query at its essence is just a collection of fields, all a GraphQL server actually needs to do in order to gather the requested data is invoke all the resolver functions for the fields specified in the query. (This is also why GraphQL often is compared to RPC-style systems, as it essentially is a language for invoking remote functions.) */
