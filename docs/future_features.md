- handeling what happens when user selevts new actor above... for now they just do not have that option as the select becomes immutable after actor inputed for it aka actorGuessed property is set to true
    - eventually, make it so that they can select a new one and when that hapens, it clears out the rest of the list below that actor and resets the actorGuessed property to false for that movier
